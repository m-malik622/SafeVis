SafeVis is a hazard detection system designed to enhance safety by using image recognition technology to detect hazardous objects behind the user and alert users via a companion mobile app.

SafeVis is a proof of concept project aimed at empowering individuals with vision and hearing impairments to navigate their world more confidently. By leveraging AI technology and custom algorithms, SafeVis aims to enhance sensory perception, helping users detect potential hazards and dangers in their environment.

## Accomplishments

While still in the proof of concept stage, we have made significant progress with SafeVis. We have developed a prototype that demonstrates the potential of the concept and showcases its core functionalities.

## What we learned

During the development process, we encountered various challenges and learned valuable lessons. We gained insights into the complexities of training custom models and deploying functional applications across different platforms. Additionally, we deepened our understanding of machine learning and explored the development of custom algorithms to interpret AI outputs effectively.

## What's next for SafeVis

Moving forward, our goal for SafeVis is to further refine and expand the concept. We plan to iterate on the design, gather user feedback, and explore opportunities to enhance the functionality and usability of the application. While it is currently a proof of concept, we are committed to continuing development efforts to eventually create a fully functional and impactful solution for individuals with vision and hearing impairments.
