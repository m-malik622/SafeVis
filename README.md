SafeVis is a proof of concept project aimed at empowering individuals with vision and hearing impairments to navigate their world more confidently. Currently, SafeVis detects moving vehicles and humans using AI technology and custom algorithms. We plan to expand its capabilities to include detecting moving bikes and predicting the paths of other moving objects.

## Accomplishments

At its current stage, SafeVis can successfully detect moving vehicles and humans, laying the foundation for its future development. The prototype showcases the potential of the concept and its core functionalities.

## What we learned

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges and gained valuable insights. We deepened our understanding of machine learning techniques and custom algorithm development to enhance sensory perception for individuals with impairments.

## What's next for SafeVis

Moving forward, our goal for SafeVis is to expand its capabilities and improve its accuracy. We plan to add support for detecting moving bikes and predicting the paths of other moving objects, further enhancing users' awareness of their surroundings. Additionally, we will continue to iterate on the design, gather user feedback, and explore opportunities to enhance the functionality and usability of the application.
